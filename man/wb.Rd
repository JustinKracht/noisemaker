\title{Wu & Browne model error method}
\usage{
wb(Omega, target_rmsea)
}
\arguments{
\item{Omega}{(matrix) Model-implied population correlation matrix.}

\item{target_rmsea}{(scalar) Target RMSEA value.}
}
\description{
Generate a population correlation matrix using the model described in Wu and
Browne (2015).
}
\details{
The Wu and Browne method generates a correlation matrix with model
  error (\eqn{\Sigma}) using

  \deqn{(\Sigma | \Omega) ~ IW(m, m \Omega),}

  where \eqn{m ~= 1/\epsilon^2} is a precision parameter related to
  RMSEA (\eqn{\epsilon}) and \eqn{IW(m, m \Omega)} denotes an
  inverse Wishart distribution. Note that \emph{there is no guarantee that
  the RMSEA will be very close to the target RMSEA}, particularly when the
  target RMSEA value is large. Based on experience, the method tends to give
  solutions with RMSEA values that are larger than the target RMSEA values.
  Therefore, it might be worth using a target RMSEA value that is somewhat
  lower than what is actually needed.
