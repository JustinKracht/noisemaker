\title{Optimize TKL parameters to find a solution with target RMSEA and CFI values}
\usage{
tkl(mod, target_rmsea = NULL, target_cfi = NULL, tkl_ctrl = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A \code{fungible::simFA()} model object.}

\item{target_rmsea}{(scalar) Target RMSEA value.}

\item{target_cfi}{(scalar) Target CFI value.}

\item{tkl_ctrl}{(list) A control list containing the following TKL-specific
arguments:
\itemize{
\item weights (vector) Vector of length two indicating how much weight to give
RMSEA and CFI, e.g., \code{c(1,1)} (default) gives equal weight
to both indices; \code{c(1,0)} ignores the CFI value.
\item v_start (scalar) Starting value to use for \eqn{\upsilon}, the proportion
of uniqueness variance reallocated to the minor common factors. Note that
only \code{v} as a proportion of the unique (not total) variance is supported
in this function.
\item eps_start (scalar) Starting value to use for \eqn{\epsilon}, which
controls how common variance is distributed among the minor common factors.
\item NminorFac (scalar) Number of minor common factors.
\item WmaxLoading (scalar) Threshold value for \code{NWmaxLoading}.
\item NWmaxLoading (scalar) Maximum number of absolute loadings \eqn{\ge}
\code{WmaxLoading} in any column of \eqn{W}.
\item penalty (scalar) Penalty applied to objective function if the
\code{NmaxLoading} condition isn't satisfied.
\item optim_type (character)  Which optimization function to use, \code{optim} or
\code{ga}? \code{optim()} is faster, but might not converge in some cases. If \code{optim}
doesn't converge, \code{ga} will be used as a fallback option.
\item ncores (boolean/scalar) Controls whether \code{ga()} optimization is done in
parallel. If \code{TRUE}, uses the maximum available number of processor cores.
If \code{FALSE}, does not use parallel processing. If an integer is provided,
that's how many processor cores will be used (if available).

\description{
Find the optimal W matrix such that the RMSEA and CFI values are as close as
possible to the user-specified target values.
}
\details{
This function attempts to find optimal values of the TKL parameters
\eqn{\upsilon} and \eqn{\epsilon} such that the resulting correlation
matrix with model error (\eqn{\Sigma}) has population RMSEA and/or CFI
values that are close to the user-specified values. It is important to note
that solutions are not guaranteed to produce RMSEA and CFI values that are
reasonably close to the target values; in fact, some combinations of RMSEA
and CFI will be difficult or impossible to obtain for certain models (see
Lai & Green, 2016). It can be particularly difficult to find good solutions
when additional restrictions are placed on the minor factor loadings (i.e.,
using the \code{WmaxLoading} and \code{NWmaxLoading} arguments).

Optimization is fastest when the \code{optim_type = optim} optimization method
is chosen. This indicates that optimization should be done using the
\code{L-BFGS-B} algorithm implemented in the \code{optim()} function. However, this
method can sometimes fail to find a solution. In that case, I recommend
setting \code{optim_type = ga}, which indicates that a genetic algorithm
(implemented in \code{GA::ga()}) will be used. This method takes longer than
\code{optim()} but is more likely to find a solution.
