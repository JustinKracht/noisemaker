Description: Tools to simulate population correlation matrices with various
    types of model error for factor analysis models. Given a factor analysis
    model, users are able to generate population correlation matrices with model
    error using the methods of Tucker, Koopman, and Linn (TKL; 1969), Cudeck and 
    Browne (CB; 1992), or Wu and Browne (WB; 2015). Users are able to specify 
    a desired RMSEA value when using the CB or WB methods. When using the TKL
    method, users can specify target RMSEA and CFI values and an optimization
    procedure will seek to find a population correlation matrix with RMSEA
    and/or CFI values that are as close as possible to the target values.
